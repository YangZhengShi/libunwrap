libunwrap installation
==============================================================================

libunwrap consists of three seperate parts: the core algorithms are written in C and two wrappers written in Matlab and Python.

C library
=========

The C library follows standard automake installation procedures. Although the source is included in the two wrappers automatically, and no manual compilation is required, one can still compile a test-routine to check things.

To compile the test program, build the package as always. For the impatient:

$ autoreconf -sfi
$ ./configure
$ make

In more detail: first, generate the necessary files:

$ autoreconf -sfi

Next, inspect the possible configuration options, then run the configuration with the desired flags

$ ./configure --help
$ ./configure

Finally, build the library and test program

$ make

The test program will be located under test/.

Matlab wrapper
==============

Custom Makefile in matlab/ directory.

Python wrapper
==============

The Python wrapper uses the default numpy.distutils installation procedure:

$ ./setup.py build [opts]

followed by 

$ ./setup.py install [opts]
