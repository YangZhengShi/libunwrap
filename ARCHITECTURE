libunwrap architecture
======================

libunwrap is a C library for unwrapping phase, with bindings in Octave and Python (NumPy). This document gives an overview of the hierarchy of the code.

C code
======

* Name: libunwrap

* Hierarchy

c/ -- C library root, includes configure and make files
c/src/ -- stand-alone C unwrapping program (optional)
c/unwrap/ -- main unwrap routines

* Build process

The C program can be built with autoconf / automake using configure.ac and Makefile.am's

Octave code
===========

* Name: unwrap.m?

* Hierarchy

octave/ -- Octave code root

* Build process

Custom Makefile

Python code
===========

* Name: unwrap.py

* Hierarchy

python/ -- Python root, include NumPy setup.py and other administrative files
python/unwrap-c/ -- Python wrapper for libunwrap, written in C with NumPy extension
python/unwrap/ -- pure Python unwrap library, wrapping unwrap-c

* Build process

The Python package is built using numpy.distutils, see setup.py for details. The ingredients for this are the C routines listed previously and the two Python wrappers (located in unwrap-c and unwrap) written in C and Python respectively.
